# MySQL
In this repository I am learning MySQL and showing the growth journey from beginner to advanced inspired by the Alex the analyst YouTube channel, you can check it out: https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst <br>
<br>
**Prequisites:** Have MySQL workbench installed and setup on your machine (guidance for that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRwITQHszU&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=3)

We'll be using the **parks_and_recreation** database, it has three tables inside it: <br>employee_demographics, employee_salary, parks_department. <br>You can download this database from the attachments on this repository.

## How to use this tutorial
</p>
<br>
This tutorial is divided into three parts:<br><br>
1. Beginner Level <br>
2. Intermediate Level <br>
3. Advanced Level <br>
<br>
For each level there is a tutorial/ example file and a try it yourself file.<br>
The example file takes you through SQL concepts with hands on examples, then you can move over to the try it yourself file that tests your knowledge of what was in the example file.<br>
